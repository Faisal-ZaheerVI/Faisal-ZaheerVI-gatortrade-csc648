# Product Summary
### Product Name
GatorTrade  
### Description of Product
Our application is tailored to the students, faculty, and staff at SFSU. Belongings they may not want anymore or think others can benefit from can be listed here. The platform will allow for SFSU students, faculty, and staff to buy, sell, or exchange items with one another. This means that the used textbooks, electronics, and other used or handcrafted goods can find new owners amongst the SFSU community. Users of this application can search and filter through categories for the goods they are looking for such as technology, books, or crafts. Also, this application is exclusively for the SF State community only. It can also be an outlet for artistic students to showcase their skills and sell handmade goods to fellow students and SFSU employees.
